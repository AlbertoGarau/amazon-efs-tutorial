== Summary

This section will create a new *EFS Access Point* for the *Amazon EFS file system*.

*Amazon EFS Access Points* is a EFS feature that simplifies providing applications and teams access to shared data sets in an EFS file system. EFS Access Points work together with AWS IAM and enforce an operating system user and group, and a directory for every file system request made through the access point.  

We will use this Access Point to create shared notebook and ML training directories on EFS file system.

== Duration
