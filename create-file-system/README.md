## Tutorial Overview

### Overview

This tutorial is designed to create an Amazon EFS environment for subsequent tutorials which are designed to help you better understand the distributed data storage design of Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) and how to best leverage this design by taking advantage of scale-out achitectures.

### Prerequisites

* An AWS account with administrative level access
* An Amazon EC2 key pair

If a key pair has not been previously created in your account, please refer to [Creating a Key Pair Using Amazon EC2](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#having-ec2-create-your-key-pair) from the AWS EC2 User's Guide.  

Verify that the key pair is created in the same AWS region you will use for the tutorial.

WARNING!! This tutorial environment will exceed your free-usage tier. You will incur charges as a result of building this environment and executing the scripts included in this tutorial. Delete all files on the EFS file system that were created during this tutorial and delete the  stack so you don’t continue to incur additional compute and storage charges.

### Step 1: Create an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

#### Parameters

- Select three (3) Availability Zones

- Use default **Network Configuration** parameters

### Create AWS CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor Burst Credit Balance

### Overview

This AWS Cloudformation template will create AWS resources to monitor and send notifications if the burst credit balance of the specified Amazon EFS file system drops below predefined thresholds.

Throughput on Amazon EFS scales as a file system grows. Because file-based workloads are typically spiky—driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time—Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time. Amazon EFS uses a credit system to determine when file systems can burst. Each file system earns credits over time at a baseline rate that is determined by the size of the file system, and uses credits whenever it reads or writes data. The baseline rate is 50 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 50 KiB/s per GiB of storage). Accumulated burst credits give the file system permission to drive throughput above its baseline rate. When a file system has a positive burst credit balance, it can burst. The burst rate is 100 MiB/s per TiB of storage (equivalently, 100 KiB/s per GiB of storage).

If a workload accessing a file system relies on the burst throughput for normal operations, running out of burst credits could negatively impact the workload so monitoring the file system's burst credit balance is essential. This AWS CloudFormation template will create two Amazon CloudWatch alarms that will send email notifications if the burst credit balance drops below two predefined thresholds, a 'Warning' threshold and a 'Critical' threshold.  These thresholds are based on the number of minutes it would take to completely use all burst credits if the file system was being driven at the highest throughput rate possible, the permitted throughput rate. You enter these minute variables as input parameters in the Cloudformation template. The 'Warning' threshold and has a default value of 180 minutes. This means that a CloudWatch alarm will send an email notification 180 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. The second alarm and notification is a 'Critical' notification and has a default value of 60 minutes. This alarm will send an email notification 60 minutes before the credit balance drops to zero, based on the latest permitted throughput rate. Permitted throughput is dynamic, scaling up as the file systems grows and scaling down as the file system shrinks. Therefore a third and fourth alarm is create that monitors permitted throughput. If the permitted throughput increases or decreases, an email notification is sent and an Auto Scaling Group will launch an EC2 instance that dynamically resets the 'Warning' and 'Critical' thresholds based on the latest permitted throughput rate. This EC2 instance will auto terminate and a new instance will launch to reset the thresholds only when the permitted throughput rate increases or decreases.

CloudWatch Alarm Examples:

| Warning Alarm | Critical Alarm | Permitted Throughput Increase | Permitted Throughput Decrease |
